## `The Last Line: })(oscar || {}, jQuery);`
```js
(function (o, $) {
    // All the code we just reviewed
})(oscar || {}, jQuery);
```
1. Define an anonymous function that takes parameters o and $
2. Immediately invoke this function with two arguments:
    - oscar || {}: If oscar exists, pass it; otherwise, pass an empty object
    - jQuery: Pass the jQuery object

This pattern accomplishes several things:

1. Creates a closure to keep variables private
1. Prevents polluting the global namespace
1. Aliases jQuery as $ inside the function (avoiding conflicts with other libraries)
1. Extends the existing oscar object if it exists, or creates a new one if it doesn't
1. Makes the code modular and reusable
